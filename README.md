# envkey-wp
## An unofficial package for using EnvKey with WordPress

This is a work in progress and not presently intended for use in production environments.

[EnvKey](https://envkey.com) is "a password manager for API keys, credentials, and config."

Requires that you install [envkey-fetch](https://github.com/envkey/envkey-fetch) on your web server.
